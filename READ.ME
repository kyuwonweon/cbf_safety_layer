**CBF Safety Layer for Franka Emika**
A real-time Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety filter for Franka Emika robots in ROS 2. It uses Pinocchio for forward kinematics and ProxQP to solve a velocity-level Quadratic Program (QP). It prevents self-collisions, floor collisions, dynamic obstacle collisions, and inter-robot collisions.

Dependencies
- ROS 2 (tested with franka_bringup and franka_description)
- Pinocchio (Rigid body kinematics)
- ProxQP (Dense QP solver)
- Eigen3 (Matrix operations)
